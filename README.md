# Scan-to-Speech
CSE 155 Project

This project is an Android app that will help vision-impaired and illiterate people use their phones to have written text spoken to them.

Using the ML Kit, https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition/android, the application reads the text in images and uses the phones speakers to read the text that the model thinks is in the image.

This application is written in Kotlin.
