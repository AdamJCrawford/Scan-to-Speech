# Scan-to-Speech
CSE 155 Project

This is an Android app that will help vision-impaired and illiterate people use their phones to have written text spoken to them.

Using machine learning, the app will read text in an image, and then, using text-to-speech, will vocalize the text in the image.

The dataset can be at https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database
The two downloads of interest are: data/words.tgz and data/xml.tgz 

The dataset should be stored in the training/dataset directory
